// It's often simpler to start with an empty build.gradle for a minimal plugin,
// as Tauri's build system will integrate it.
// However, if you need specific dependencies for your plugin's Android part,
// you would add them here like in a standard Android library module.

// For this specific plugin, we need AndroidX Core for WindowInsetsControllerCompat.
// Ensure your main app's build.gradle also has compatible versions.
// This assumes your main app already includes common AndroidX libraries.

dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.core:core-ktx:1.9.0" // Example version, align with your project
    // No explicit tauri-android dependency needed here usually,
    // as it's provided by the main app's Tauri integration.
}

// You might need to specify a namespace if your AGP version requires it
// android {
//     namespace "com.tauriplugin.immersive" // Match your plugin's Kotlin package
// }
