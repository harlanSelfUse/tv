// This file is now a placeholder.
// Player logic has been refactored into:
// - player_vars.js
// - player_navigation.js
// - player_ui_helpers.js
// - player_utils.js
// - player_dplayer_handler.js
// - player_core_logic.js (which contains initializePageContent and event listeners)

// player_core_logic.js should handle the DOMContentLoaded and passwordVerified listeners
// to call initializePageContent.
// Ensure player.html loads these scripts in the correct order.
console.log("Main player.js loaded (now refactored). Core logic in player_core_logic.js");
